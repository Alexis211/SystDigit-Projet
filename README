Contents of the repository :
----------------------------

sched/
	A scheduler for netlists.
	Input : a netlist.
	Output : a netlist with topologically sorted operators
	 plus a dumbed-down version for input to the C circuit simulator
	$ cd sched/
	$ ocamlbuild main.byte

camlsim/
	A circuit simulator written in OCaml.
	This program does NOT do the scheduling. The netlist must be passed through sched/ first.
	$ cd camlsim/
	$ ocamlbuild simulator.byte

csim/
	A circuit simulator written in C.
	This program does NOT do the scheduling.
	This program does NOT read a netlist, it reads a specifically formatted dumbed-down netlist, that
	is output by the scheduler.
	$ cd csim
	$ make

minijazz/
	The MiniJazz compiler (not our doing).

*.pdf
	Documentation about the project.



CONVENTION FOR BINARY VALUES
----------------------------

/!\ This convention is contrary to the one used in the example file nadder.mj
	(Therefore I have modified that file...)

The bit array [a_0 a_1 a_2 ... a_n-1] represents the decimal number :
	a_0 + 2*a_1 + 4*a_2 + ... + 2^(n-1)*a_n-1

When represented in binary, we write the bits in the order :
	a_0 a_1 a_2 ... a_n-1

/!\ BINARY NUMBERS ARE WRITTEN REVERSE !
