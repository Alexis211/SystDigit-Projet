Contents of the repository :

sched/
	A scheduler for netlists.

	 plus a dumbed-down version for input to the C circuit simulator
	$ cd sched/
	$ ocamlbuild main.byte

camlsim/
	A circuit simulator written in OCaml.
	This program does NOT do the scheduling. The netlist must be passed through sched/ first.
	$ cd camlsim/
	$ ocamlbuild simulator.byte

csim/
	A circuit simulator written in C.
	This program does NOT do the scheduling.
	This program does NOT read a netlist, it reads a specifically formatted dumbed-down netlist, that
	is output by the scheduler.
	$ cd csim
	$ make
